# Fixes Applied to Bausan Website

## 🖼️ Image Loading Issues Fixed

### Problem
Images were not loading because of incorrect paths with GitHub Pages subdirectory deployment.

### Solution Applied
1. **Created custom image loader** (`imageLoader.js`) to handle basePath for Next.js Image components
2. **Updated Next.js config** to use custom image loader
3. **Fixed CSS background-image** in hero section to use correct path
4. **Updated 3D model GLB path** to work with basePath

### Files Modified
- `next.config.mjs` - Added custom image loader configuration
- `imageLoader.js` - New file for handling image paths
- `components/hero-section.tsx` - Fixed background image path
- `components/concrete-model-3d.tsx` - Fixed GLB model path

## 🎮 3D Model Implementation

### Problem
The 3D GLB concrete wall model was not being used in the site despite being available.

### Solution Applied
1. **Integrated 3D model** into the About section
2. **Enhanced scroll-driven animation** to match your original vision
3. **Improved camera movement** - model rotates and moves as user scrolls
4. **Disabled auto-rotation** for more controlled, architectural feel

### Changes Made
- `components/about-section.tsx` - Replaced ConcreteShowcase with ConcreteModel3D
- `components/concrete-model-3d.tsx` - Enhanced scroll-driven animations
- Model now responds to scroll with smooth camera movement through the wall

## 🚀 All Path Issues Resolved

### Fixed Paths
- ✅ CSS files: `/_next/static/css/` → `/Bausan.github.io/_next/static/css/`
- ✅ JavaScript: `/_next/static/chunks/` → `/Bausan.github.io/_next/static/chunks/`
- ✅ Images: `/images/` → `/Bausan.github.io/images/`
- ✅ Fonts: `/_next/static/media/` → `/Bausan.github.io/_next/static/media/`
- ✅ 3D Model: `/models/` → `/Bausan.github.io/models/`

## 🎯 3D Experience Details

Your original vision is now implemented:
- **Scroll-driven camera movement** through the concrete wall
- **Architectural feel** with controlled, smooth animations
- **Building reveal effect** as users scroll down
- **No gimmicks** - clean, structural, professional presentation

The 3D model will:
- Rotate gradually as user scrolls
- Move through depth (z-axis) creating "camera through wall" effect
- Have subtle breathing animation for life
- Maintain architectural/structural aesthetic

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** all changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix image paths and implement 3D scroll-driven model"
   git push
   ```

2. **Wait for deployment** (2-3 minutes)

3. **Test the site** at `https://www.fahrschule06.ch/Bausan.github.io/`

## ✅ Expected Results

After deployment, you should see:
- ✅ All images loading correctly
- ✅ Hero background image visible
- ✅ Gallery images displaying
- ✅ 3D concrete wall model in About section
- ✅ Smooth scroll-driven 3D animations
- ✅ No 404 errors in console
- ✅ Professional, architectural presentation

The site will now match your original vision of a scroll-driven 3D experience with the concrete wall model, combined with properly loading images and assets.
